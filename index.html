<h2>About nature</h2>
<p>The local nature is modest and generous at the same time.<br> Most of the territory of the Pavlodar Irtysh region is flat boundless steppes, where it is easy and free to breathe, where it is spacious to the eye, and the soul is joyful. <br> In the north - a corner of the forest-steppe with shy birch pegs.</p>
